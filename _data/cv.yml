         - <b>Thesis Title:</b> Design and Implementation of an Android Application for Integrating Reporting and Complaints Systems Procedure across Governmental Organizations
         - Supervised by <a href="http://facultymembers.sbu.ac.ir/aliakbary/">Dr. Sadegh Aliakbari</a>
         - <b>Summary:</b> Since most governmental organizations and local councils have their specific reporting and complaints systems, this project aimed to address the concern that citizens may not know which authority is responsible for a specific type of problem in a particular location. In this regard, we have designed and implemented an Android application to integrate reporting and complaints systems across organizations. Leveraging this framework can make it more straightforward to inform the local authority of the problems needing their attention and also lead to a significant improvement in Citizen Relationship Management (CzRM).
