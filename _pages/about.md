I am a Ph.D. student at the Division of Software and Computer Systems (SCS) of KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I work under the supervision of [Mihhail Matskin][misha_profile] and [Amir H. Payberah][amir_profile]. My Ph.D. journey began in June 2021. Prior to that, in January 2020, I've got my master in software engineering from [Sharif University of Technology][sharif_page] in Tehran, Iran. 


Nowadays, my primary research interest is leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to design recommendation systems. These systems are designed to provide personalized suggestions to users based on their past behaviors, preferences, and interests. NLP techniques can be particularly helpful in this context, as they can help to extract valuable insights from unstructured data sources such as product descriptions, user reviews, and social media posts.
 <!-- By applying NLP techniques to these data sources, we can develop more accurate and effective recommendation systems that can better capture user preferences and provide more relevant suggestions. -->
